About me
------
My name is Zhongkai Zhang, and I am a master student in the Robotics Institute, School of Mechanical Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Currently, I am working under the supervision of Prof. Chungang Zhuang on robot modeling, calibration & identification; robot motion & force control. In my master's study, I have published 2 first-author paper (including a RA-L) and participated in multiple works (e.g., TMECH, ICIRA). 

I am actively seeking a PhD position starting in Fall 2026 to further deepen my expertise in robotics and explore new possibilities for the applications of robot control in physical interaction scenarios.
