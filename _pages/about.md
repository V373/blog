About me
------
My name is Zhongkai Zhang (张忠恺), and I was a master student in the Robotics Institute, School of Mechanical Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, supervised by Prof. Chungang Zhuang. Currently, I am working in [MIRoC lab](https://meweb.hku.hk/zljiang/) at the University of Hong Kong as a Research Assistant advised by [Prof. Zhongliang Jiang](https://mech.hku.hk/academic-staff/jiang-z-l/), focusing on robot manipulation and interaction with physical world.

During my master's study, I have published 2 first-author papers (including a RA-L) and participated in multiple journal/conference papers (e.g., TMECH, ICIRA). I am now actively seeking a PhD position starting in Fall 2026 to further explore new possibilities for the applications of robot control / manipulation in physical interaction scenarios. 

Please feel free to contact me via email if you are interested!


Education
------
- _Sept. 2023 - Mar. 2026_, **Shanghai Jiao Tong University**, M. Eng. in Mechanical Engineering

Research & Publications
------
In my past research, I primarily focused on:
1. robot modeling, calibration & identification;
2. residual motion/torque error compensation;
3. robot motion & force control.

The overview of my previous works is shown in the following figure.

In the future, I would like to explore new possibilities in:
1. intelligent control/perception with learning-based approaches
2. robot manipulation for physical human-robot interaction (pHRI) scenarios
