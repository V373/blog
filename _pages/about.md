About me
------
My name is Zhongkai Zhang (张忠恺), and I am a master student in the Robotics Institute, School of Mechanical Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Currently, I am working under the supervision of Prof. Chungang Zhuang on robot modeling, calibration & identification; robot motion & force control.

During my master's study, I have published 2 first-author papers (including a RA-L) and participated in multiple journal/conference papers (e.g., TMECH, ICIRA). I am now actively seeking a PhD position starting in Fall 2026 to further deepen my expertise in robotics and explore new possibilities for the applications of robot control in physical interaction scenarios. 

Please feel free to contact me via email if you are interested!
